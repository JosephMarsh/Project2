            <h1>About Me.</h1>


                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>
                    Having grown up in an Airforce family, I traveled allot as a child.  I've
                     seen many parts of the world and have a wide scope of imagination.  
			I enjoy creating worlds and exploring new possibilities.
                </p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p> 
                    have have a love for science, reason and math (not that I’m great at them 
                    mind you).  I have a good sense of humor and I’m told I’m pretty funny.  
                    I work in IT full time and go to school full time so I don’t get to game as much as I’d like anymore. 
                    But I’m a huge fan of the pen and paper form of role playing game. It’s the best way to get to 
                    understand systems and try and wrap your mind around creating one of your own.  
                    If you want to develop games, the pen and paper experience is invaluable.  
                    Board games too, for that matter.
                </p>

                <h3>Professional</h3>
                <p> 
                    I've spent most of my life in the Army.  I was originally tricked into becomeing a 
                    telephone operator.  The MOS was called “Computer Network Switching Systems 
                    Operator”.  Luckily I was only disappointed in this choice for about 2 years.  
                    Then the Army trained me to be one of the very first Operators of their new IP 
                    based telephone switching systems.  I learn about networking, sub-netting, codecs 
                    and all kinds of useful concepts and skills in today’s technology hungry world.  
                    Eventually I became a team chief, before leaving the service with 11 years
                    under my belt.

                <h3>Home life</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m currently married to a beautiful woman and an attention sponge of a daughter. 
                    When I’m not working or slaving away over homework, I’m trying teach my 
                    &ldquo;Pumpkin&rdquo; the ABCs or helping my wife manage her Ebay business.  She sells vintage 
                    photo prints and calls her store Evocative Walls. I have two dogs that are currently
                    keeping my grandmother company. They are both part terrier and part... something. 
                    Their names are Maggie and Jack.

                <p>

                    Cisco IOS command line language. I'm strong in both C# and Java object oriented programming
                    languages and have trained on Eclipse and Visual Studio respectively. below are a list of 
                    languages roughly ordered according to my comfort level im them.
